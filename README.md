Research on helpful input for my final project for my technology class. 
I am building a small rotary LED object similar to disco balls but instead of a party ambience I am looking for a tranquil and peaceful LED animation that resembles twinkle stars or satisfying patterns that will be in a loop as white noise music is playing in the backgroud.
I am new to coding so I am trying to create an LED animation that mimicks twinkle lights on arduino. Any help is truly appreciated.
